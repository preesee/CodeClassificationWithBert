# CodeClassificationWithBert
For code classification, unzip and release the csv training data in folder 'data'. 
This repo provides the code for reproducing the experiments in ASTBERT: A Fine-tuned BERT model for Programming Languages based on ASTs. Unlike many other AST-based tools ASTBERT uses the subtrees of ASTs to extract syntactical information from programming languages.
